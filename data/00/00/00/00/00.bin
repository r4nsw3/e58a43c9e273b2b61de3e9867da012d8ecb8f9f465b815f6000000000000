  |   Mojang has announced that Minecraft players on Switch will be able    |
  |   to download a new update later today. A number of new features and    |
  |   elements will be added, including the lantern, loom and lectern,      |
  |   shields, and more.                                                    |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Hey, watch where you're pointing that crossbow! I'm as excited as     |
  |   anyone that it's coming to Minecraft today - with three new           |
  |   enchantments to boot - but I'd also like to get through writing this  |
  |   Minecraft.net article without a bolt being fired at me and ruining    |
  |   my lovely hair.                                                       |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Actually, the crossbow isn't the true star of this new update.        |
  |   That'll be the lantern, which is sure to light up your life!          |
  |   We've also added the loom and the lectern, items that will no doubt   |
  |   loom up your life and lectern up your life, respectively.             |
  |   Give them a try!                                                      |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Look at me rambling about book holders and medieval weaponry when     |
  |   I should be talking about the real star of the R10 update - Jellie,   |
  |   the cat YOU voted to be added to Minecraft! Jellie, stand up and      |
  |   take a bow!                                                           |
  |                                                                         |
  |   No, wait, I know the actual star of this update - shields!            |
  |   You're just 1 iron ingot and 6 wooden planks away from being able     |
  |   to defend yourself against all sorts of hostile mobs (and other       |
  |   players, too).                                                        |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Shields will also help defend you from the new hostile mob,           |
  |   Pillagers (are they the true stars of this update?                    |
  |   No way, they're JERKS). Defence won't actually be necessary just      |
  |   yet, because Pillagers are only coming to Creative Mode in this       |
  |   update.                                                               |
  |   But what about in a later update? Let's just say you might want to    |
  |   start practising crafting and using that shield now.                  |
  |                                                                         |
